Capture knowledge. Find information faster. Share your ideas with others. Save projects, meeting notes and marketing plans right in your WordPress installation.

== Description ==

=== Your knowledge management should make you look smart. Like an assistant that always has your back. ===

Have you felt frustrated by your note-taking app?

* Did you endlessly look for a note you have written?
* Created time-consuming documents nobody looked at again?
* Never came back to that great idea you wrote down?
* Were you anxious for not hosting your notes on your own servers?

=== Manage your knowledge. Have your records always ready. ===
